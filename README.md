InTouch is a mobile app developed in Android using Android Studio. The app has a simple approach of saving the contact information of the people you get in touch with at events or meetup, in an easy and simple way, just by saving the person's name, email, phone, and a note about how did you met (to help you memorize your people!!!)

All the contacts that you save are stored in you phone's contacts local database with your other contacts, and can be accessed from your default contacts or dialer app.
